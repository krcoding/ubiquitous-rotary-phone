# ubiquitous-rotary-phone

## Repo by Katherine Randazzo


My first repository for IDPT-1996-01. Rotary phones may be obsolete, but *dang,* do they have charm. There were plenty of kinds around, back in the good ol' days. While mobile phones and smartphones are __sleek__ and have their convenience, there's nothing like a good ol'-fashioned rotary phone.
